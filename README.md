Runs a microcontroller to read inputs and write outputs accordingly, such that a display is multiplexed

Currently, there is a plan to use two Arduinos to manage the display multiplexing. 
The goal is to eventually move all the multiplexing control to a single microcontroller, 
but this method should save time and allow for testing in the short term.
